# GW2-DecoRBT
Simple python script that could be run to automatically edit Guild Wars 2 saved homestead layout files.   

## Description
This program will reads two XML layout files, specifically named `RBT_origin` and `RBT_shift` to generate the output. The output XML is a Guild Wars 2 layout file with a combined `props` from both files.
> RBT_origin	= the decoration you want to move, and one new prop (point of reference)

> RBT_shift 	= the new prop (point of reference) inside the destination layout

# How to Use
You got two options to choose from:
1. If you have no problem downloading some requirements, you can head to the `source` folder and copy the `GW2 DecoRBT.py` to your own PC.
2. If you don't want any requirements, look inside `executable` folder and download the `GW2 DecoRBT.exe` into your PC.
