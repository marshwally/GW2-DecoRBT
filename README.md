# GW2-DecoRBT
Simple python script that could be run to automatically edit Guild Wars 2 saved homestead layout files.   

This program reads two XML layout files ("RBT_origin", "RBT_shift") to generate the output layout.
  > RBT_origin	= the decoration plus one new prop (point of reference)

  > RBT_shift 	= the new prop (point of reference) moved to new location

# Requirements
  - Python 3.8 or higher
  - NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
